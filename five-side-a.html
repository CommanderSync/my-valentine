  <h1>You are so caring, it makes me fall deeper in love with you!</h1>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">Cupcake, you care so much. Little things. Little things you care about. Like a sprain I had, etc. You worry about me. Cupcake, you also care about my sleep pattern! I feel so loved whenever you worry about the stupid shit I do, seriously. I mean, you take care of the smallest aspects of me. You make me sleep and get my sleep right. You make me have my food on time. You make me call my parents when I forget sometimes. You made me stop punching the walls when I get stressed. You make me take more care of myself. You get so worried when I sprain an ankle! I mean, ankles are meant to get sprained, but still you care so much. So much. I love you so much baby, for taking care of even my smallest things. I love you so much baby. I feel truly blessed when I think about all this, because I have a partner who cares about me more than I do myself. You really are the perfect partner too! I'm learning so much from you, haha. Another perfection point, see? I worry about you in the same way actually haha, guess we're even there. But baby, yes. You're so caring that it is just another aspect that adds on to your perfect self, Ms Perfect!</p>
