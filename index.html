  <h1>"13 Reasons Why You're Perfect" -Dennis</h1>
  <h2>Baby, it's true. You really are perfect. Completely..</h2>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">I'm no writer, but I hope this makes you smile! And yes, I'll say it again. You are perfect, Ms Perfect. Also, I really couldn't make the website more beautiful like all the others I have in such a short time, babe! The project would've gone longer then, after Valentines Day too! Sorry about that and bear with this ancient website format. :3</p>
