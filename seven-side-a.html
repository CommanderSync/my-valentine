  <h1>Here it is. The Final Reason.</h1>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">This reason, is another reason and probably the biggest reason which says why you're perfect. Baby, you're perfect. Know it. Everything about you. All our +1s. All our similarities. Your thoughts. Your approaches. Your ideas. You. The whole freaking package. You. It's just perfect. Babe, I mean, this final reason is probably one you won't count as a reason, but for me, this is a huge reason. And that is, You are always You! And that is perfect. You are what you are. I love you more than you can imagine for that. As we spoke, you aren't one who pleases others. You are one who lives in the moment. Just like me. That is freaking perfect. Not just that, everything about you screams perfect! We synced so well, and from that moment on, I knew that you're perfect for me. Baby, I'm so in love with you that I can't explain how I felt after reading your email. Baby, thank you for everything. We'll be spending our entire life together, and you should know that you're perfect. And know it now. I can't wait for the day when I would wake up to you everyday and kiss you every morning and make you a warm cup of coffee while you're still in bed, completing a book you started. That's my definition of a perfect life. A life that starts and ends with you, that's all. Nothing else, just this. I love you, S. I love you so much. Happy Valentines Day! I'll be there by your side, always and forever at anything you do. You'll have me forever and I'll make sure I'll you'll be worry free and happy and healthy; because at the end of the day your happiness and health is what drives me and keeps me happy. I love you so much cupcake. I'm yours and you're mine..</p>
