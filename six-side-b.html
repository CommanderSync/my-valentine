  <h1>Our craziness! I love it, absolutely!</h1>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">Babe, you say we're weird. You say we're crazy. You know, your weird and crazy is PERFECT! AGAIN! It is! You lighten up every day of my life, I completely cherish every moment we do crazy things! I absolutely love it! And I love you, completely, to infinity and beyond! Baby, seriously, I love it when you randomly chat about things I hadn't thought of, and how you chat and talk to me over the phone AT THE SAME TIME! Baby, our craziness really sync and that's another reason for me to call you perfect! I found someone who is as crazy as me, and that's all I would've ever asked for. At the end of the day, you're still my cupcake. The perfect little cupcake I love. I love the crazy you and it's another aspect that adds to your perfection!</p>
