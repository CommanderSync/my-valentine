  <h1>You are so lovable!</h1>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">Baby, yet another point that adds to your perfection! You're so lovable! I mean, I could kiss you and tell you how much I love you for hours. All this, just because of the beautiful personality you are. All this just because of the perfect personality you have. You know just to say what to say when, and you say things that I always wanted to hear. Also, you are so freaking cute! I love the random stickers you send to me at class, or the spam of messages, you getting angry at me, you shouting at your cousins in Bengali ( which I'm learning slowly ), you and me talking in songs, you and me listening to songs together, me reading you books and you patiently listening, you talking to me on the phone telling me what all you did in the day. I LOVE ALL OF IT! EVERYTHING! All this just makes my infinite love for you become more and more infinite! All these things you do make my day worth calling a day, and I crave for these moments with you everyday. I totally love you, darling. And this is yet another aspect for your perfection.</p>
