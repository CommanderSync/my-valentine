  <h1>You get me going every single day. You're the reason I give my best at everything</h1>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">Hm, it's been 10 reasons now babe, yeah? Also, now it's time for you to know this. I think I told you this before. Baby, I know you love me. And this perfection point is, that you taught me how to dream bigger. It's something I couldn't do much before, but now I'm limitless! Baby, every dream of mine that I tell you, you just make it more achieveable, knowing that you got my back. You back me up for everything I dream. Be it any dream related to my career or my activities. And you always back me up, always. You always tell me that you'll be there with me no matter what. You said you'll be there in my tough times and in my good times. That's your perfection. That's you. Only you and probably my parents and sister would say that babe. The others would leave at the tough times, you know? I mean, nobody ever has given me assurance of having my back like you. Well, I do have my 3 best friends but we're separated by time-zones and stuff. But baby, you gave me the assurance that you'll be there at every step in my life. That's all I want. And I'll be there at every step of your life. Wait, it ain't my life or your life. It's our life. Baby, our life together is gonna go just right. We got each other and that's all we need. All of it will fall in place. Well, that is another perfection point in you.</p>
