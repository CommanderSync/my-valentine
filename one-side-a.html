  <h1>Your flaws add to your perfection.</h1>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">Baby, don't you say "How do you call me perfect? I have so many flaws, re!". You know what? Those attributes you call "flaws" just add to your perfection. I love those flaws, however big or small. Everybody have flaws. It's natural. But you, baby, your flaws are something that I'd treasure all my life. They're flaws that I'd wrap around my arms rather than fixing them because they make you who you are. They mould you. They along with all your perfections, add up to you. And you, are perfect as is. These "flaws" just add on to the perfect person you are. That's all.</p>
