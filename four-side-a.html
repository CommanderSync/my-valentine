  <h1>Your laugh, I'm addicted to it</h1>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">Aw babe, this one is one perfection point I wanted to say ever since the first reason. Seriously! Whenever we talk over the phone, I just wait for you to give your short laughs that are so freaking cute! God, everytime you laugh, my heart melts and makes me forget all my worries about studies or work or anything for that matter! Everytime you laugh, my heart skips a beat. I try and make you laugh over the phone sometimes by saying stupid things because your laugh is so freaking beautiful. For every laugh of yours, I get more calmed internally. Your laugh is one that I wanna hear all my life. I'd learn proper stand-up comedy just to see you smile and laugh with that perfect laugh.</p>
