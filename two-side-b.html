  <h1>Only you can handle this mess of a person.</h1>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">Well baby, you're perfect for me, yet again. You're my freaking definition of perfect because in all these cases only you are clearly PERFECT! Baby, you handle me when I make mistakes. Remember when I broke Rule #1 and called you on accident and you just put the phone down saying "I don't want to talk to you"? Well, do you remember how beautifully you handled me? Do you? I mean, you still asked me not to blame myself when I was clearly the one to blame, haha! And then, like on the 12th February, when I had a bad day and you pranked me that you're dating someone else? The worst day? Do you have any idea how you changed my day and my life after that day? You did wonders darling, serious wonders. Nobody could do that.</p>
