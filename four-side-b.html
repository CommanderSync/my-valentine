  <h1>Did I say that you're freaking beautiful? Guess I did, but I'll do it again!</h1>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">Cupcake, you are so beautiful! You complain about your hair going wild, etc. Baby, that's perfect! You're so beautiful! I mean, I saw you on the video call + the one picture you sent me. I saw the picture and damn are you perfection! You're so beautiful, you know? Also, the video call. You said your hair is unmanaged, etc. But you know what? That's your perfection. You are beautiful no matter what. I'd kiss you and never get tired of doing it, because you're perfect. Completely.</p>
